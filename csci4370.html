            <h2>CSCI4370: Database Management (Spring 2013)</h2>

            <h3>Course content:</h3>
            <p>

                CSCI4370 provides the student with a comprehensive introduction to the design of databases and the use
                of database management systems for applications. The course presents two perspectives on database
                management: (1) internal workings of a database management system, and (2) application development using
                a database server. To support 1st perspective the students are asked to build a prototypical database
                system from scratch using Java programming language in several steps. To support 2nd perspective the
                students are requested to develop a web-based database application to store and query various types of
                data of their choice. Both type of projects will be team-based and expose students to collaborative
                nature of database programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout the course we will cover the relational model and, and SQL - the standard language for
                creating, querying, and modifying relational and object-relational databases. From a more theoretical
                perspective we
                will cover relational algebra, relational design principles based on functional dependencies and normal
                forms, and the entity-relationship approach to database design. A variety of other issues important to
                database designers and users will be covered, including indexes, transactions, and integrity
                constraints. Physical data organization, various indexing techniques and their advantages and
                disadvantages at certain situations will be discussed. Basics of query processing and optimization will
                be presented as time permits. At different stages in the course, we will address several practical
                topics such as using MySQL, programming in SQL, JDBC and other database tools.

            </p>
            <h3>Time &amp; Place:</h3>
            <p>CSCI4370 meets Mondays, 3:35 - 4:25 (GSRC 208), Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 3:30 - 4:45 (GSRC 208). </p>
            <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
            <p>
                The programming projects will use Linux/Windows and MySQL or PostgreSQL database management systems, and
                the Java programming language. We will assume students are already proficient in Linux/Windows and Java.

            <h3>Projects:</h3>

            <p>
                Lectures in all topics is complemented by a significant term project for developing a database
                application using MySQL (or PostgreSQL), and a set of smaller projects in which students build a
                prototype database system. The term project will require a proposal (application and Web framework) and
                must be approved before implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each project group will include 4 members. Each project contains detailed submission instructions as
                well as some test data and grading criteria.

            <h3 align="left">Late Policy:</h3>
            <p align="left"> Programming work will be submitted electronically, and must be submitted by midnight on the
                date that it is due. Programming work submitted after the deadline but less than 24 hours late will be
                accepted but penalized 10%, programming work submitted more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours late
                will be penalized 20%, and programming work submitted more than 48 hours but less than 72 hours late
                will be penalized 30%. No programming work will be accepted more than 72 hours late. THIS LATE POLICY
                WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED. </p>
            <h3 align="left">Regrade Policy:</h3>
            <p align="left"> Please send an email message to TA stating that you believe you deserve a project part
                regrade, and explaining precisely why. Please include your name, and the number of the project part in
                question. </p>
            <h3 align="left">Programming Work:</h3>
            <p align="left"> Eeach team is expected to submit their own original work. On many occasions it is useful to
                ask others (the instructor, the TA's, or other students) for hints or debugging help, or to talk
                generally about programming strategies. Such activity is both acceptable and encouraged, but you must
                indicate any assistance (human or otherwise - except liserv discussions/TA/instructor help) that you
                received. In any event, you are responsible for coding, understanding, and being able to explain on your
                own all project work that you submit. We will pursue aggressively all suspected cases of Honor Code
                violations, and they will be handled through official University channels. If you have any questions
                about this policy or about the degree to which we will pursue Honor Code violations, please discuss your
                concerns with the course staff immediately. </p>
